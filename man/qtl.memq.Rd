\title{Performs Multi-Environment (or Multi-Trait)
Multi-QTL analysis for balanced populations.}
\usage{
qtl.memq (crossobj = crossobj, P.data = NULL, env.label = NULL,
               trait, step, method, threshold, distance,
               cofactors, window.size = 50)
}
\arguments{
\item{crossobj}{An object of class = cross obtained from the qtl.cross
function from this package, or the read.cross function from r/qtl package
(Broman and Sen, 2009).This file contains phenotypic means, genotypic
marker score, and genetic map data.}

\item{P.data}{The name of the file containing the phenotypic information
in a long format.}

\item{env.label}{vector with the names of the environment (or traits)
to select for the QTL analysis.}

\item{trait}{name for the phenotypic trait to be analyzed.}

\item{step}{Maximum distance (in cM) between positions at which the genotype
probabilities are calculated, though for step = 0, probabilities are
calculated only at the marker locations.}

\item{method}{'SIM' or 'CIM' for simple interval (SIM) or
composite interval mapping (CIM).}

\item{threshold}{options are: Li&Ji (Li and Ji, 2005),
FDR (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995), and set alpha levels (p.values).}

\item{distance}{To avoid co-linearity, nearby markers are not allowed
in the same model. This is the minimum distance within which two markers
are allowed to stay in the model.}

\item{cofactors}{Vector of genetic predictors to be used as cofactors}

\item{window.size}{To avoid co-linearity, marker cofactors close to the
markers being tested are not allowed in the model. This is the minimum
distance to allow a co-factor when testing for a specific marker. Given the
resolution of common QTL studies, it is recommended to use a large
window.size (i.e. 50 cM). The default is set to 50 cM.}
}
\value{
The function returns a data.frame with the final QTL indicating
the locus names, chromosome, position, p.values tested and QTL effects
that are printed to qtl_memq_reports.
}
\description{
Mixed models have been used in balanced populations to detect
QTL-by-environment (QEI) effects while modeling the variance-covariance
matrix. This function performs a multi-environment (or multi-trait)
multi-QTL biparental analysis modeling the correlations across
environments (traits).

'SIM' or 'CIM' could be perform.
