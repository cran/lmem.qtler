\description{
The data is the well-known Steptoe x Morex doubled haploid population
developed in the early 90s by the North American Barley Mapping Project.
The objective was to improve in the understanding of the genetic basis of
agronomic and malting quality traits in barley.
The population consists of 150 doubled haploids lines;
of which 148 have been genotyped by SNP markers
(we use here 794 SNP markers).
The population was extensively evaluated for several agronomic and
malting quality traits (Hayes et al. 1993) in many locations and years
(US and Canada). In this example we use information on yield and heading
date in one of those trials.
