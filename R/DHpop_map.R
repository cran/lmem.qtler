#'For this example, a doubled haploid population of 200 individuals was
#'developed by crossing a short line (parent A), with a tall line (parent B).
#'The 200 doubled haploid lines were evaluated in a field trial and the plant
#'height measured in cm (the data is in the file DHpop_pheno.txt).
#'The population was also genotyped by SNPs, and the data is presented in the
#'file DHpop_geno.txt.
#'The map location of each of the markers is in the file DHpop_map.txt.

#' @format A data frame 130 row (markers) and 3 column.Column 1 gives the marker names,
#' column 2 the chromosome on which the marker has been mapped, and column 3 indicates
